# Real-Time Weather Monitoring and Alerts System

This project is a **Real-Time Weather Monitoring and Alerting System** that allows users to set preferences for weather alerts based on temperature thresholds, select cities, and monitor weather data. The system fetches data from the **OpenWeatherMap API** and displays detailed weather information for selected cities. It uses **LLMs (Large Language Models)** to generate weather summaries and sends email alerts if certain conditions are met.

## Features:
- Monitor real-time weather data for various cities.
- Set temperature thresholds and receive email alerts if thresholds are exceeded.
- Generate two-line weather summaries using an LLM.
- Display real-time weather metrics and temperature changes over time in a user-friendly UI.
- Automatic data collection every 5 minutes.
- Supports city-wise weather data, alerting, and interactive visualizations.

## Design Choices:

- **Streamlit UI**: Used for building the front end, making it simple to create interactive web-based data monitoring dashboards.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Used to fetch real-time weather data for cities. The data includes temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.
- **Firebase**: Used as the data storage system to save weather data. The system can retrieve historical weather data for analysis and alerting.
- **LLMs**: Utilized to generate short summaries of the weather for the user.
- **Scheduler**: Automatically fetches data every 5 minutes and stores it in Firebase for further processing.

## Dependencies:

You can find all the necessary dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file.

You can install these dependencies with the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Setup Instructions:

### 1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnKiTu03/Zeotap-assignment.git
cd Zeotap-assignment/Weather-A2
```

### 2. Install Dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables:

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder with the following content:

```env
API_KEY: Your OpenWeatherMap API key.
api_key: Gemini API key.
Password_email: To send Emails for weather alerts .
```

Make sure to replace the placeholders with actual values. 


### 4. Firebase Setup:

1. Place the Firebase configuration file (`zeotap-dddc1-firebase-adminsdk.json`) in the `config/` folder.
2. Ensure the Firebase account is properly configured to store and retrieve weather data.

### 5. Running the Application:


1. Start the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run frontend/app.py
```

## Usage Instructions:

1. **Input Page**:
   - Enter your email address and choose the city for weather monitoring.
   - Set temperature thresholds (e.g., trigger an alert if temperature exceeds 35°C).
   - Select the number of consecutive updates required for an alert.
   - Choose between Celsius and Kelvin units for temperature.
   - Save preferences and switch to the weather monitoring page.

2. **Weather Monitoring Page**:
   - View real-time weather metrics for the selected city.
   - Check a detailed weather summary generated by an LLM.
   - Monitor temperature changes over time through interactive plots.
   - Receive email alerts if thresholds are exceeded.

---

## Additional Features:

- **Auto Data Fetching**: The app automatically fetches new weather data every 5 minutes and updates the UI.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Real-time temperature data is displayed using interactive charts for easier understanding.
- **Email Alerts**: Configured email alerts notify users if the temperature exceeds a set threshold for multiple updates.
- **LLM-Powered Summaries**: A concise two-liner summary of the weather conditions is generated by an LLM.

---

## Future Improvements:

- **Add More Cities**: Support additional cities and allow users to select multiple cities for comparison.
- **Historical Data**: Enhance the historical data section for better trend analysis.
- **User Authentication**: Add user authentication for a more personalized experience.
- **Custom Alerts**: Allow users to configure custom alerts for specific weather conditions (e.g., humidity, rain).
  
---

## Troubleshooting:

- **API Key Issues**: Ensure that the OpenWeatherMap API key is correct and valid.
- **Firebase Issues**: Verify that the Firebase configuration file (`zeotap-dddc1-firebase-adminsdk.json`) is placed in the `config/` folder and the database rules allow reading and writing.
- **Email Alerts**: Ensure that Mailgun credentials (API key and domain) are correctly configured in the `.env` file.
